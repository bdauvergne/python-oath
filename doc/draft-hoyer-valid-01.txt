1.  Introduction

   The Authentication-Data Validation Service Interface definition
   (VALID) describes a Web-service interface for a validation server.
   The specification reuses data definitions from [SAML], [WS-Security]
   and [WS-Trust] and operates over version 1.2 of [SOAP].  Upon
   successful validation, the validation server returns a SAML assertion
   containing verified attributes of the authenticated end-user or a
   hardware or software device under the end-user's control.
   Communications between the end-user and the application are not
   required to follow the Web-services programming model.

1.1.  Key Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Notation

   This specification uses the following syntax to define outlines for
   messages:

      The syntax appears as an XML instance.

      Characters are appended to elements and attributes to indicate
      cardinality:

      "?" (0 or 1)

      "*" (0 or more)

      "+" (1 or more)

      The character "|" is used to indicate a choice between
      alternatives.

      The characters "(" and ")" are used to indicate that contained
      items are to be treated as a group with respect to cardinality or
      choice.

      The characters "[" and "]" are used to call out references and
      property names.

      Additional child elements and/or attributes MAY be added at the
      indicated extension points (see Section 10) but MUST NOT
      contradict the semantics of the parent and/or owner, respectively.
      By default, if a receiver does not recognize an extension, the

Internet-Draft                    VALID                     January 2010


      receiver SHOULD ignore the extension; exceptions to this
      processing rule, if any, are clearly indicated below.

      XML namespace prefixes (see Table 1) are used to indicate the
      namespace of the element being defined.

      Elements and Attributes defined by this specification are referred
      to in the text of this document using XPath 1.0 expressions.
      Extensibility points are referred to using an extended version of
      this syntax:



         An element extensibility point is referred to using {any} in
         place of the element name.  This indicates that any element
         name can be used, from any namespace other than the namespace
         of this specification.

         An attribute extensibility point is referred to using @{any} in
         place of the attribute name.  This indicates that any attribute
         name can be used, from any namespace other than the namespace
         of this specification

1.3.  Namespaces

   The following XML namespace prefixes are used in the specification.

   env:    http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope

   Authentication data:  Information exchanged between the end-user and
      the validation server as part of the authentication process.  For
      example a password, an OTP, the response to a challenge, etc.

   Authentication policy:  The combination of authentication mechanisms
      required to complete successfully before access may be granted.

   Client :  See "Application".

   End-user:  The authentication subject.

   Moving factor:  The factor that makes a one time password
      computationally unique in combination with a fixed key.  For
      example the increasing event counter value in [HOTP].

   Server:  See "Validation server".

   Validation server:  The system component that validates
      authentication data.

2.  Authentication-Data Validation Service Interface overview

   The Authentication-Data Validation Service Interface allows
   communication of the following data elements in several different
   communication patterns as described in Section 3.  The interface is
   based mainly on [WS-Trust].  The following sections apply
   terminologies and concepts defined in [WS-Trust].

2.1.  Authentication data communication

   The specific requirements for authentication data communication
   depend upon the specific authentication mechanism.

   In-band authentication data SHALL be passed in the body of <wst:
   RequestSecurityToken> and <wst:RequestSecurityTokenResponse>
   elements.

2.2.  Verified attributes

   Upon successful validation of the authentication data, the validation
   server SHALL issue a SAML assertion containing verified end-user or
   token attributes, depending if the server is validating user
   identities (user centric authentication) or device/token
   (pseudonomous - token centric authentication) .  The client MAY
   provide a <wsp:Policy> element indicating which attributes it
   requires.  Required attributes SHALL be referenced using the <saml:
   Attribute> element, with the <saml:AttributeValue> child element
   omitted.

   The validation server MAY include the sub-set of the requested
   attributes whose verified values are known to it.  Otherwise, the
   validation server SHALL include all verified attributes whose values
   are known to it.  These attributes MUST be included in the SAML
   assertion.  They MUST also be included in a separate <wst:Claims>
   element.  In this way, the application may treat the assertion as
   opaque data, extracting any attributes it requires from the <wst:
   Claims> element.

   Attributes SHALL be expressed as <saml:Attribute> elements in
   accordance with the SAML V2.0 X.500/LDAP Attribute Profile.

2.3.  Challenge/response

   Multi-step authentication mechanisms are supported as shown here.

  Message     Direction            Cardinality

  Request     Client  -> Server    Exactly one
  Response    Client <-> Server    (Zero or more request-response pairs)
  Response    Client <-  Server    Exactly one

   The protocol terminates when the validation server either includes at
   least one security token according to [WS-Trust] in the response or
   returns an <env:Body/env:Fault> element.

2.4.  Token collections

   A set of tokens MAY be requested and issued in a single set of
   exchanges with the validation server using the "token collection"
   features of WS-Trust.

                          In-band authentication

   The end-user accesses the application (1).  The application supplies
   the authentication data to the validation server and receives an
   assertion in return (2).

   For in-band challenge/response authentication mechanisms, additional
   messages between the end-user and the validation server MUST be
   relayed by the application.

   The "In-band 2 way challenge/response" pattern is shown in Figure 2.
   This pattern is based on the In-band Challenge/Response pattern but
   authenticates both the server and the client.  The application
   receives an in-band client challenge (1).  The application invokes
   the validation server (2).  The validation server returns the
   response to the client challenge and a server challenge (3).  The
   application passes the server response and server challenge to the
   end-user (4).  The end-user may or may not transform the server
   challenge and after verifying the server response sends the result to
   the validation server in-band (5).  The application supplies the
   authentication data to the validation server and receives an
   assertion in return (6).

4.  Asynchronous communication

   The out-of-band communication patterns (Section 3.2 and Section 3.3)
   require asynchronous behavior, so that the application thread is not
   blocked while the challenge is being processed by the end-user.

4.1.  Out-of-band challenge

   In the case of the "out-of-band challenge" pattern (Section 3.2), the
   validation server SHALL return an <env:Body/env:Fault> element with
   the value:

      valid:Pending

   The validation server, upon sending this value, and the application,
   upon receiving it, SHALL terminate the current session.

   Once the application receives the response from the end-user, it
   SHALL initiate a new session with the validation server.

4.2.  Out-of-band response

   In the case of the "out-of-band response" pattern (Section 3.3), the
   validation server SHALL return an <env:Body/env:Fault> element with
   the value:

      valid:Pending

   The validation server, upon sending this value, and the application,
   upon receiving it, SHALL terminate the current session.

   Both parties MUST maintain the <wst:RequestSecurityToken/@Context>
   attribute as metadata associated with the initial session.  In the
   subsequent session, they MUST use this <wst:RequestSecurityToken/@
   Context> attribute value to correlate the challenge and response.

5.  User centric and device centric (pseudonymous) authentication models

   There are two authentication models supported by this specification:

5.1.  User Centric authentication model

   In this model the mapping between a specific user and the devices
   that belong to the specific user is known and managed by the
   validation server.  This means that the authentication request will
   contain explicit user information in form of a UserId

5.2.  Device Centric authentication model

   In this model the validation server does not have any knowledge to
   whom a specific device belongs.  The user-device mapping will be at
   the appllication or service provider.  This means that the
   authentication request MUST NOT contain uer information and that it
   MUST contain information to uniquely identify the device by using the
   <DeviceInfo> element as defined in [PSKC].

6.  Authentication moving factor resync

   Some authentication schemes gradually lose synchronization between
   client and server.  In order to compensate for this, the server must
   accept authentication data values within a range, or window of the
   moving factor (e.g. the event counter used in event based one time
   password algorithms, see [HOTP]).  When an authentication moving
   factor drifts to the edge of, or beyond, the server's window for a
   particular end-user, the server has to adjust its window.  This
   process is known as resyncing.

   Resyncing erodes assurance in the authentication event.  So,
   following a resync event, the validation server commonly requests a
   second authentication data value, which effectively restores the
   level of assurance provided by the authentication.

   The following two approaches to resyncing exist:

6.1.  Automatic re-sync based on authentication data

   In this approach, the resynchronisation is based only on the
   authentication data.  In this apporach the server searches through an
   extended window of the moving factor(s) to see if it can match the
   presented authentication data.  In this apporach two OTPs MUST be
   transmitted so that the server MUST try to match the first OTP with
   the extended window and also MUST match the second OTP with a normal
   window.

6.2.  Manual re-sync based on presenting moving factor values

   In this approach to resynchronisation, the server is given the exact
   value of the moving factor (e.g. the event counter value in [HOTP])
   together with the OTP.  The server MUST only set the moving factor(s)
   to the received value if the OTP matches successfully (given the new
   moving factor values).

7.  Policy models

   Authentication policy defines the requirements for accessing a
   resource in terms of mechanisms and their strengths, expressible in
   disjunctive normal form (that is a disjunction ("OR") of conjunctions
   ("AND"s)).  This approach supports risk-based multi-factor
   authentication.

   Two policy models are supported.  In the first model (see figuer
   below), the application is responsible for invoking the right
   combination of validation servers in order to satisfy the
   authentication policy.

8.  Common message contents

   This section describes the mechanism-independent requirements for
   message contents.

8.1.  Request Security Token

   The message-independent requirements for "request security token"
   messages are shown in this example:

<wst:RequestSecurityToken Context=" ... ">
    <wst:TokenType>
http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/oasis-wss-saml-token-profile-1.1#SAMLV2.0
    </wst:TokenType>
    <wst:RequestType>
http://www.docs.oasis-open.org/ws-sx/ws-trust/200512/Issue
    </wst:RequestType>
    <wsp:AppliesTo> ... </wsp:AppliesTo> ?
    <wsp:Policy> ?
        <saml:Attribute> +
    </wsp:Policy>
    <wst:Lifetime> ... </wst:Lifetime> ?
</wst:RequestSecurityToken>

   <wst:TokenType> - MANDATORY  The client SHALL set the value 'http://
      docs.oasis-open.org/wss/
      oasis-wss-saml-token-profile-1.1#SAMLV2.0'.  If the server detects
      a different value it MAY return a fault.

   <wst:RequestType> - MANDATORY  The client SHALL set the value
      'http://www.docs.oasis-open.org/ws-sx/ws-trust/200512/Issue' If
      the server detects a different value it SHALL return a fault.

   <wsp:AppliesTo> - OPTIONAL  If present, the client MUST set the value
      to a URI identifying the resource, or class of resource, to which
      access is requested.  If the validation server is policy-aware, it
      SHOULD use this value to select the applicable authentication
      policy.  Otherwise, it MUST ignore it.

   <wsp:Policy/saml:Attribute> - OPTIONAL  If present, this element MUST
      identify a verified end-user attribute requested from the
      validation server.  Even if the validation server cannot provide
      all the requested attributes, it SHOULD proceed with the
      validation process.

Internet-Draft                    VALID                     January 2010


   <wst:Lifetime> - OPTIONAL  The client MAY specify the lifetime of the
      requested assertion using this element.  The server MUST verify
      that the requested lifetime conforms with its own policy for
      assertion lifetimes.

   <wst:RequestSecurityToken/@Context> - MANDATORY  This attribute MUST
      be set by the client.  It is an opaque value to the server.  The
      server MUST use the value as the <wst:RequestSecurityToken/@
      Context> value in the response.

8.2.  Request Security Token Response

   The common requirements for the final "request security token
   response" message are shown in this example:

   <wst:RequestSecurityTokenResponse Context=" ... ">
       <wst:RequestedSecurityToken>
             ...
       </wst:RequestedSecurityToken>
       <wst:Claims Dialect="...">
           <saml:Attribute/> +
       </wst:Claims> ?
       <wsp:AppliesTo> ... </wsp:AppliesTo> ?
       <wsp:Policy> ?
           <wsp:RequiredElement> +
       </wsp:Policy>
   </wst:RequestSecurityTokenResponse>

   If the authentication data failed to validate, then the server MUST
   include the <env:Body/env:Fault> element containing the value wst:
   FailedAuthentication.  In this case, it SHALL NOT include any other
   elements.

   If the authentication data failed to validate due to missing
   authentication data, then the server MUST include the <env:Body/
   env:Fault> element containing the value valid:
   MissingAuthenticationData.  The server can optionally include
   elements indicating which authentication data is missing.

   <wst:RequestedSecurityToken> - OPTIONAL - Zero or more  If validation
      is complete and successful, then the server SHALL include a SAML
      assertion containing verified end-user attributes.  Otherwise this
      element SHALL be omitted.  The server SHOULD set the assertion
      lifetime in accordance with the lifetime specified in the request,
      or its own policy, whichever is more restrictive.

   <wst:RequestType> - MANDATORY  The client SHALL set the value
      'http://www.docs.oasis-open.org/ws-sx/ws-trust/200512/Issue' If
      the server detects a different value it SHALL return a fault.

   <wst:Claims> - OPTIONAL  If present, the server SHALL populate this
      element with verified end-user attributes.

   <wst:Claims/@Dialect> - OPTIONAL  The server SHALL set the value
      "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0".  The client MAY reject responses
      containing a different value.

   <wpt:AppliesTo> - OPTIONAL  If the authentication assurance level
      achieved is suitable only for a sub-set of resources, the
      validation server MUST set a value that identifies that sub-
      set.The client SHOULD restrict access to resources falling within
      the sub-set defined by this element.

   <wst:RequestSecurityToken/@Context> - MANDATORY  The server MUST
      include the @Context value from the request.  The client SHOULD
      load the context identified by the value.

9.  Mechanism-specific message contents

   The mechanism-specific requirements for message contents are
   described in the appendices.  These MAY be used in any combination.

10.  Extensibility

   This section lists a few common extension points provided by VALID:

   New VALID Version:  Whenever it is necessary to define a new version
      of this document then a new version number has to be allocated to
      refer to the new specification version.  The rules for
      extensibililty are defined in Section 11.

11.  IANA Considerations

11.1.  XML namespace registration

   This section registers a new XML namespace,
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:valid", per the guidelines in [RFC3688].

   URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:valid

   Registrant Contact:  Philip Hoyer (phoyer@actividentity.com).

   XML:

   BEGIN
   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML Basic 1.0//EN"
     "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic/xhtml-basic10.dtd">
   <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <head>
     <meta http-equiv="content-type"
           content="text/html;charset=iso-8859-1"/>
     <title>VALID Namespace</title>
   </head>
   <body>
     <h1>Namespace for VALID</h1>
     <h2>urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:valid</h2>
   <p>See <a href="[URL of published RFC]">RFCXXXX
       [NOTE TO IANA/RFC-EDITOR:
        Please replace XXXX with the RFC number of this
       specification.]</a>.</p>
   </body>
   </html>
   END

11.2.  VALID Version Registry

   IANA is requested to create a registry for VALID version numbers.
   The registry has the following structure:

     VALID Version              | Specification
   +---------------------------+----------------
   | 1.0                       | [This document]

   Standards action is required to define new versions of VALID.  It is
   not envisioned to depreciate, delete, or modify existing VALID
   versions.

12.  Security Considerations

   The validation server SHOULD authenticate the client and limit access
   to the validation service only to authorized clients.  This MAY be
   achieved by object level security (e.g xml signatures as defined in
   [XMLDSIG] applied to the <env:Header> and <env:Body> elements),
   transport layer security (e.g.  [TLS]) or network layer security
   (e.g. isolated network segment).

   The application MAY authenticate the validation server.  This MAY be
   achieved by object level security (e.g. xml signatures as defined in
   [XMLDSIG] applied to the <env:Header> and <env:Body> elements or
   assertion), transport layer security (e.g.  TLS) or network layer
   security (e.g. isolated network segment).

   The chosen authentication mechanism MUST ensure freshness of the
   exchanges in order to detect replay attacks.

   Privacy of the authentication data and end-user attributes MAY also
   require protection.

Appendix B.  Mechanism specific message contents

   The follwing subsections describe the mechanism specific message
   contents for each considered mechanism:

B.1.  Username/password

   This section describes the mechanism-specific message contents
   username/password transferred in-band.  There are no semantics
   implied by the order of the elements.  The username and password
   transmission uses the web services security Username Token Profile
   [WSS_UsernameTokenProfile].

   There are two steps to the protocol.

   Step 1 - Client sends "request security token" message containing
   authentication data to the validation server.

B.3.  In band one-time-password (OTP) token synchronization

   This section describes the mechanism-specific message contents for
   both time-based, event-based and time-event based OTP algorithms in
   which resynchronization data is sent in-band.

   Synchronization can happen either by sending two subsequqnt OTPs from
   the device or by sending only one OTP and the exact values of one or
   multiple moving factors (e.g.Counter, TIme, etc) used in the OTP
   algorithm.

   There are two steps to the protocol.

   Step 1 - Client sends "request security token" message containing
   synchronization data to the validation server.

      validation window upon successful validation of the first OTP.

   <wst:RequestSecuityToken/wss:Security/valid:SyncCounter>  If present,
      the client MUST set the value to the current OTP Counter moving
      factor from the claimed device.  The server MUST validate that the
      given OTP corresponds to the given value in <valid:SyncCounter>
      and then set the Counter moving factor value to its own record for
      the claimed token.

   <wst:RequestSecuityToken/wss:Security/valid:SyncTime>  If present,
      the client MUST set the value to the current OTP Time moving

      then set the Time moving factor value to its own record for the
      claimed token.

   The server MUST confirm that all the supplied synchronization data

   <env:Body/env:Fault>
           valid:Pending
   </env:Body/env:Fault>

   Both the client and server close the session.

   Step 4 - Server sends "request security token response" message
   containing the authentication result to the client at the registered
   call-back interface.

B.7.  Client supplies challenge

   This appendix describes the mechanism-specific message contents for
   challenge/response mechanisms in which the client supplies the
   challenge.  There are no semantics implied by the order of the
   elements.

   There are two steps to the protocol.

   Step 1 - Client sends "request security token" message to the
   validation server, passing both the challenge and the response.

<wst:RequestSecurityToken Context="...">
    <wst:TokenType>

</wst:RequestSecurityToken>

   <wst14:InteractiveChallenge>  The challenge.  This may have been
      obtained from the validation server by means of another interface;
      one not specified here.

   <wst14:InteractiveChallengeResponse>  The client MUST set the value
      to the transformed challenge.  The server MUST validate the
      transformed challenge.

   Step 2 - Validation server returns "request security token response"
   message containing the assertion and claims to the client.

B.8.  Challenge/response with signature

   This appendix describes the mechanism-specific message contents for
   challenge/response authentication mechanisms in which both the
   challenge and response are transferred in-band additionally to other
   parameters that are used in a signature (such as the simmetric
   signature in [OCRA].  There are no semantics implied by the order of
   the elements.

   There are four steps to the protocol.

   Step 1 - Client sends "request security token" message containingthe
   claimed identity to the validation server.

 <wst:RequestSecurityToken Context="...">
    <wst:TokenType>
http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/oasis-wss-saml-token-profile-1.1#SAMLV2.0

        <pskc:DeviceInfo> ...</pskc:DeviceInfo> ?
    </wss:UsernameToken>
</wst:RequestSecurityToken>

   Step 2 - Validation server sends "request security token response"
   message containing the set of challenges to the client.

   <wst:RequestSecurityTokenResponse Context="...">
       <wst14:InteractiveChallenge> +
           ...
       </wst14:InteractiveChallenge>

   <wst:RequestSecurityTokenResponse/wst14:InteractiveChallenge>  The
      server MUST set the contents to the value of the challenge(s).

   Step 3 - Client sends "request security token response" message
   containing the response(s) to the server.

   <wst:RequestSecurityTokenResponse Context="...">
       <wst14:InteractiveChallengeResponse> +

   <wst:RequestSecurityTokenReponse/wst14:InteractiveChallengeResponse>
      The client MUST set the value to the parameters of the signature
      (e.g. amount is set to '10000').  The server MUST validate the
      transformed challenge.

   Step 4 - Server sends "request security token response" message
   containing the authentication result to the client.

   <wst:RequestSecurityTokenResponse Context="...">

Appendix C.  Use Cases

   This section describes a comprehensive list of use cases that
   inspired the development of this specification.  These requirements
   were used to derive the primary requirement that drove the design.
   These requirements are covered in the next section.

   These use cases also help in understanding the applicability of this
   specification to real world situations.

C.1.  Validation

C.1.1.  OTP Validation

   An application needs to validate an OTP obtained from an end-user,
   before providing the end-user with access to the requested
   resource(s).  The validation request may pass through several SOAP
   intermediaries.  If this is the case, the application message needs
   to specify the ultimate validation server endpoint via SOAP
   addressing means, e.g., by using SOAP actors, to avoid the OTP being
   evaluated several times.  The response may include additional
   instructions to the token, for example that it needs to be
   resynchronized.  This information must be defined inside a SOAP
   message.

   Valid credentials that can be passed in the valildation request:

   o  Username, PIN + OTP

   o  Username, OTP

   o  TokenId + OTP

   o  Array of TokenId + OTP

C.1.2.  Challenge/Response Validation - Server generated challenge

   An application needs to be able to use a token implementing the OCRA
   challenge/response algorithm for identifying the end user.  The
   application requests from the validation server the challenge to be
   presented to the token (with the end-user keying the challenge into
   the token by means of a PINPad) or the challenge presented to the API
   of the connected token The application then uses the protocol to
   verify the response from the token

C.1.3.  Challenge/Response Validation - User generated challenge

   An application needs to be able to use a token implementing the OCRA
   challenge/response algorithm for identifying the end user.  The
   application generates the challenge to be presented to the token
   (with the end-user keying the challenge into the token by means of a
   PINPad) or the challenge presented to the API of the connected token
   The application then uses the protocol to verify the challenge and
   the response from the token.

C.1.4.  2-way mutual Challenge/Response Validation

   An application needs to be able to use a token implementing the OCRA
   2 way challenge/response algorithm for identifying the end user and
   the user will identify the validation server.  A connected token
   generates a client challenge and trasnmits it to the appllication,
   the application will accept the challenge and send it to the
   validation server, which will then return a server-response to the
   client challenge and a server challenge.  The connected token will
   verify the server response and after successfully validating the
   server response sends uses the server-challenge to generate a client-
   response which is sent to the appliaction.  The application then uses
   the protocol to verify the the response from the connected client.

C.1.5.  OTP Validation + Server managed PIN

   An application needs to be able to use a token implementing the TOTP
   algorithm as one factor and a server managed PIN as a second factor,
   for indetifying the end user.  The verification of both factors
   should occur within one message request/response pair of the
   protocol.

C.1.6.  MatrixCardValidation - Server generated challenge

   An application needs to be able to use MatrixCard challenge/response
   algorithm for identifying the end user.  The application will request
   from the validation server the challenge to be presented to the user
   via the user interface and the user response entered into a webform
   The application will then use the protocol to verify the response
   from the token

C.2.  Synchronisation Use Cases

   This section describes the use cases relating to synchronisation of
   the token and the server.

C.2.1.  OTP Token Resync with the Next OTPs

   An application needs to validate an OTP but the OTP could not be
   validated because the OTP moving factor is out-of-sync between the
   token and the server.  The validation server detects that the given
   OTP corresponds to a future moving factor that falls in an acceptable
   re-sync window.  The application decides that a re-sync is necessary.
   It asks the next generated OTP from the token to re-sync the token.
   The validation server adjusts its record of the token's moving factor
   to the one that corresponds to the given OTP upon successful
   validation.  Two consecutive OTPs could also be directly used for a
   validation server to re-sync a token, where the server tries to match
   the first OTP with an extended synchronization window and then match
   the second OTP with a normal authentication window.

C.2.2.  OTP Token Resync with Moving Factor

   An application needs to validate an OTP but the OTP could not be
   validated because the OTP moving factor is out-of-sync between the
   token and the server.  The validation server detects that the given
   OTP corresponds to a future moving factor that falls in an acceptable
   re-sync window.  The application decides that a re-sync is necessary.
   It uses values that can be read by the user of the token (e.g. event
   counter value, time interval counter value) to re-sync the token
   together with the next generated OTP of the token.

        to token synchronization)

   R3:  The protocol needs to support the following algorithms

        *  HOTP

        *  OCRA

        *  TOTP
